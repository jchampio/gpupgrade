# gpupgrade command-line interface(cli)

See the accompanying ```README.md``` for more context on developing for gpugrade.
This document discusses gpupgrade from the standpoint of someone using gpupgrade to
actually upgrade their cluster.

### Summary

We run the following commands.  Each command prints some status information, and you can see the state 
of the conversion by running ```gpupgrade status upgrade```.

1. ```gpupgrade prepare init --old-bindir OLDDIR --new-bindir NEWDIR```

1. ```gpupgrade prepare start-hub```

1. ```gpupgrade check config```

1. ```gpupgrade prepare start-agents```

1. ```gpupgrade prepare init-cluster```

1. ```gpupgrade prepare shutdown-clusters```

1. ```gpupgrade upgrade convert-master```

1. ```gpupgrade upgrade copy-master```

1. ```gpupgrade upgrade convert-primaries```

1. ```gpupgrade upgrade validate-start-cluster```

1. ```gpupgrade upgrade reconfigure-ports```


NOW:

1. ```gpupgrade initialize --old-bindir OLDDIR --new-bindir NEWDIR```
1. ```gpupgrade execute```
1. ```gpupgrade finalize```

###TODO

1. why is ```Install binaries on segments``` always pending?

### Details

Shown here is the result of running each command, as well as the output of running
```gpupgrade status config``` after each command.

1 ```gpupgrade prepare init --old-bindir OLDDIR --new-bindir NEWDIR```


No output is given; you specify the old and new binary directories for gpdb.  If you attempt
to check the status of the upgrade, it will fail as the status reporting requires the agent:

   ```
   → gpupgrade prepare init --old-bindir /usr/local/gpdb/bin --new-bindir /usr/local/gpdbNEW/bin
   → gpupgrade status upgrade
   [ERROR]:-couldn't connect to the upgrade hub (did you run 'gpupgrade prepare start-hub'?)
   ```
   
   ```
   (optional)
   → gpupgrade config show
   new-bindir - /usr/local/gpdbErasemeU/bin
   old-bindir - /usr/local/gpdbEraseme/bin
   ```
   
2 ```gpupgrade prepare start-hub```

No output is given; this starts the hub on the master.  At this point, you can get status
information
